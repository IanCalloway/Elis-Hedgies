Ian Calloway About:
My name is Ian Calloway. I am 15 years old but will be turning 16 on may 1st.
Last year I was invited to the CO after my groups project won. To be honest I didnt
feel like I deserved to be there. I didnt really contribute much and our group leader 
really took charge and did almost all the work. But after going to the CO I decided I would
really try this year as I guess something there just motivated me. So I did. I found a client 
who also was my brother and made this little hedgehog website with my group. He didnt
make things so easy though. Our client didnt give much to work with so I had to go and take images 
and design a logo for the site as I felt responsible since it was my brother being hard to work with. 
Me and Devin took charge on most the work. Devin making the framework for a couple pages 
and I fixing all the bugs and making the website look good. Some of the pages I did completly 
on my own such as the Home, Contact, and Hedgehogs page. I spent alot of time working on it at 
home and used every minute I could in school. During this project I ended up finding I loved 
coding and especially designing things. I didnt think I would do so much work this year honesly
but im glad I did because with each page I tried something difftent and learned something new.
I think the most difficult problem I kept facing when working with some of the pages was the 
flexing to diffrent screen sizes. But that challenge I ended up figuring out as all our pages
now flex pretty well and look way better than they did before on mobile. 

Devin Austin About:
I worked on the HTML and CSS of about half of the pages, mostly on the framework. This was my 
first time using those languages in a big collaborative project, so I learned a lot about my limitations
with coding and working with other people and how to overcome them. I remember specifically on one of
the pages how we had an issue with the margins for one of our CSS elements. It looked like it was 
going to take up another day or two of work due to rewriting until I remembered how I used to mess with
the Chrome developer console when I was in middle school and that it displayed the invisible aspects 
of an element if you hovered over it. Thanks to that, we were able to get the page done within the hour
and have more time to spend on smaller details that may well have been overlooked. I can't say I prefer 
HTML and CSS now over languages I've used like C# and Python, but I have a newfound respect for them that 
I would not have had otherwise, and overall I enjoyed this project no matter the outcome.
