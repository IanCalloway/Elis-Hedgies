Ian Calloway About:

My name is Ian Calloway. I am 15 years old but will be turning 16 on May 1st. Last year I was invited to the CO after my group's project won. To be honest I didn't feel like I deserved to be there. I didn't contribute much that year, and our group leader took charge and did almost all the work. But after somehow getting to go the CO I decided that I would really try this year. So I did because if I did manage to get there again I would know I earned it this year. So I found a client, who also happened to be my brother, and made this hedgehog website with my group. Our client didn't make things so easy though. Our client didn't give us much to work with so I had to go and take images and design a logo for the site at home as I felt responsible since it was my brother being hard to work with. I and Devin took charge of most of the work for the construction. Devin made the framework for a couple of pages such as the CARE and ABOUT page and I fixed all the bugs and made the website look good by styling and adding all the content. Some of the pages I did completely on my own such as the Home, Contact, and Hedgehogs page. I spent a lot of time working on them at home and used every minute I could in school. During this project, I ended up finding I loved coding and especially designing things. I didn't think I would do so much work this year honestly but I'm glad I did because with each page I tried something different and learned something new. I think the most difficult problem I kept facing when working with some of the pages was flexing to different screen sizes. But that challenge was dealt with as I ended up figuring it out. Luckily most of my challenges were made quick to overcome as Devin was great at finding solutions online for whatever I brought him.

Devin Austin About:

I worked on the HTML and CSS of about half of the pages, mostly on the framework. This was my first time using those languages in a big collaborative project, so I learned a lot about my limitations with coding and working with other people and how to overcome them. I remember specifically on one of the pages how we had an issue with the margins for one of our CSS elements. It looked like it was  going to take up another day or two of work due to rewriting until I remembered how I used to mess with the Chrome developer console when I was in middle school and that it displayed the invisible aspects  of an element if you hovered over it. Thanks to that, we were able to get the page done within the hour and have more time to spend on smaller details that may  well have been overlooked. I can't say I prefer  HTML and CSS now over languages I've used like C# and Python, but I have a newfound respect for them that  I would not have had otherwise, and overall I enjoyed this project no matter the outcome.

!An Extra Note PLEASE READ!

During the making of this project, Kobalt our male hedgehog passed away due to age. Our client is taking a break from breeding as he will need to raise two new parents. Sadly this also means Fiona is reaching the same age as Kobalt and will be unable to care for any more babies. Due to this Kobalt and Fiona will be presented on the page as they are until the future parents reach the proper age and we can replace their images and profiles. (We are also thinking of adding a kind of memorial to Kobalt and Fiona to one of the pages when this time comes.) As you would imagine, this means all the hedgehogs you see on the HEDGEHOGS page are images from past litters, and their names and profiles are placeholders to show what the site would look like with actual hedgehogs present for sale.
