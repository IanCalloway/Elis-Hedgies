              My name is Kobalt. I am super friendly. 
              I love being held and I never ball up. 
              I am one of the nicest hedgies you will meet. 
              This also tends to rub off on my kids.
              I actually came from one of Eli's old litters. 
              He has cared for me since I was born.

              Hi my name is Fiona. The name 
              came a little from 
              Shrek but mainly from
              a puppy in a past litter of ours. 
              As for me I am also extreamly lovable.
              Though I may not be as friendly as my
              friend Kobalt, I am still a great mother.
