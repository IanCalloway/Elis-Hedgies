              This is Eli. He raises hedgehogs.
              He has been doing this for a few years and thought a 
              website would be much easier to sell through since 
              he cant conduct sales on facebook due to his age.
              So we made a website for him to advertise instead.
              Eli is great with animals. He helps care for not just hedgehogs but has had experience
              of breeding and raising with puppies, angora rabbits, chickens, and cats.
              With this experience its safe to say his hediges are 
              well cared for.
