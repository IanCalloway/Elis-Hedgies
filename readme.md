Ian Calloway About:
My name is Ian Calloway. I am 15 years old but will be turning 16 on may 1st.
Last year I was invited to the CO after my groups project won. To be honest I didnt
feel like I deserved to be there. I didnt really contribute much and our group leader 
really took charge and did almost all the work. But after going to the CO I decided I would
really try this year as I guess something there just motivated me. So I did. I found a client 
who also was my brother and made this little hedgehog website with my group. He didnt
make things so easy though. Our client didnt give much to work with so I had to go and take images 
and design a logo for the site as I felt responsible since it was my brother being hard to work with. 
Me and Devin took charge on most the work. Devin making the framework for a couple pages 
and I fixing all the bugs and making the website look good. Some of the pages I did completly 
on my own such as the Home, Contact, and Hedgehogs page. I spent alot of time working on it at 
home and used every minute I could in school. During this project I ended up finding I loved 
coding and especially designing things.
