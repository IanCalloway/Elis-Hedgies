        An enclosure 2ft wide and 4ft long is good, 
        though no animal will complain about having more 
        space than they “need”. Keep in mind as well that
        hedgehogs are also great climbers so their cage should have high walls or be fully enclosed.
        Due to their high activity more space is better and dont
        be shy to let them roam the room. Just make sure its secure.
        The tempature of the cage should be around 70º - 85ºF (21º - 29ºC).
        Hedgehogs dont usually play with toys but providing something
        like a wheel is great for them. Acceptable bedding materials include 
        shredded paper, newspaper, recycled pelleted/absorbable material, 
        and wood shavings, such as aspen or untreated pine.

        A pet hedgehog’s diet should mainly consist 
        of high-quality hedgehog food mixed with high-quality, 
        low-fat cat food. Some things such as gut-loaded insects,
        fresh fruits and vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs can be
        given in small amounts to your hedgehog about 2 to 3 times a week.
        You should also make sure water is availible to your hedghog 24 hours a day.

        Hedgehogs are not very clean animals. 
        They do not use litter pans, and in fact 
        enjoy covering themselves in their own saliva and 
        feces. Moreover, male hedgehogs can sometimes 
        cover themselves in their own semen which can then 
        harden onto their fur and be very difficult to get off.
        While hedgehogs do have spines, they are less like the 
        hard quills of a porcupine and more like the texture of a brush.
        Hedgehogs do roll into a ball and raise their spines as a defense 
        mechanism. They will probably do this the first few times you 
        pick them up until they get used to you (this is called hand taming)
        Hedgehogs make for very cheap pets. They usually cost between $20-40 per month
